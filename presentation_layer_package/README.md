```bash
mason make presentation_layer_package --name=presenetation_layer_package_name
```

Generates the file structure that makes up the presentation layer.

This layer is made up of the folders `assets`, `bloc`, `extensions`, `widget`, and the file `types`.

In the `assets` folder are the resources that will be used in the views globally and are reused throughout the app.

The files related to the logic and state management global to the app are stored in the `bloc` folder (business logic component).

In the `extensions` folder are the useful extensions that will be used in the views globally and are reused throughout the app.

In the `widget` folder, the widgets that will be used in the views globally are defined and are reused throughout the app.

In the `types` file, the functions to inject blocks that will be used in the pages are defined.
