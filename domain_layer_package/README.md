```bash
mason make domain_layer_package --name=domain_layer_package_name
```

Generates the file structure that makes up the domain layer.

This layer is made up of the `entities`, `repositories`, `result` and `usecases` folders.

The application's domain entities are stored in the `entities` folder.

In the `repositories` folder the repository interfaces are defined.

In the `result` folder, the reusable classes for the response of the repository interfaces are defined.

The use cases of the application are defined in the `usecases` folder.
