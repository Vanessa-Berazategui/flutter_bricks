Generates the file structure that makes up a stateful feature of an application without flavors, this feature goes under the lib of the base structure of the project.

A feature is made up of the `bloc`, `page`, `view` and `widget` folders.

The files related to logic and state management are stored in the `bloc` (business logic component) folder.

In the `page` folder the corresponding page routes are defined (using [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router)) to the created module.

In the `view` folder the views of each of the screens corresponding to the module are defined.

In the `widget` folder the widgets that will be used in the views are defined.
